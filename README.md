# Environment Setup

# Data Download

Several datasets need to be downloaded in order to train this model
* First, we need to get the synthetic images and masks from the GrassClover Dataset. 
    ```
    $ wget https://vision.eng.au.dk/?download=/data/GrassClover/synthetic_images.zip -cO synthetic_images.zip
    ```
* Second, we need to grab the CropAndWeed Dataset. Navigate to the authors' [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cropandweed/cropandweed-dataset/tree/main) and follow the instructions there to download the data.
